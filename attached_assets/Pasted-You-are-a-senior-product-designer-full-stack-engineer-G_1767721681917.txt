You are a senior product designer + full-stack engineer.

Goal
Build a production-quality “Teaser Web App” (marketing landing site) for Maliya — an AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant for UAE users. This is NOT the core product app; it’s a public-facing teaser site that explains the value, showcases features, builds trust, and collects early-access signups.

Core requirements (must follow)
1) Output a complete web app codebase in a single response:
   - Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript.
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS.
   - Use a clean minimalist design (premium feel).
   - Include responsive design (mobile-first).
   - Include light/dark mode toggle.
   - Include subtle animations (Framer Motion).
   - Include SEO: metadata, OpenGraph, Twitter cards, sitemap, robots.
   - Include accessibility basics: proper headings, aria labels, contrast.
   - Include a simple environment-based config file for links/brand text.

2) Teaser site focus:
   - Provide strong “what it is”, “why it matters”, “how it works”.
   - Provide multiple “screenshot placeholders” where app screenshots will be added later.
   - Provide a waitlist/early access signup form (frontend + API route + storage).
     Storage can be:
       Option A: simple JSON file storage for local dev (no external deps).
       Option B: SQLite via Prisma (preferred if you can keep it simple).
     Include basic bot protection (honeypot field + rate limit in-memory).
   - Provide a “TestFlight / Beta” CTA section with placeholders (do not include real links, use config placeholders).
   - Provide a “Changelog / What’s New” section (based on v1.0.2+3 items below).
   - Provide trust/privacy copy emphasizing user control and secure handling (no exaggerated claims).
   - Provide a FAQ section targeted to UAE users.

3) Screenshot placeholders (must include)
   - A hero device mock section with 1 large screenshot placeholder.
   - A “Feature gallery” with 6 screenshot placeholder cards:
     (a) Overview dashboard
     (b) Statement import / Share Sheet
     (c) Statement processing status / reliability
     (d) Forgot password / reset flow
     (e) Merchants & insights
     (f) Notifications (future-ready)
   - Each placeholder must be implemented as a component that can later swap to real images easily:
     - Accept props: title, description, aspectRatio, “tag” label.
     - Use a tasteful skeleton/blur pattern background.

4) Content and positioning (must align with Maliya)
   - Maliya tagline: “AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant”
   - Key feature bullets must include:
     - Import PDF bank statements directly (Share Sheet on mobile).
     - Reliable statement loading and clearer errors.
     - Better handling of password-protected PDFs.
     - Secure forgot password / reset password flow (deep link handling ready).
     - Polished Apple + Google sign-in experience.
     - Insights-ready processing pipeline (describe generally, no sensitive architecture).
   - Tone: premium, minimalist, confident, not hype-y. Avoid “guarantees”.

5) Pages / routes (must include)
   - /
     - Hero + CTA (Join waitlist)
     - Social proof placeholder row (logos placeholder)
     - Feature highlights
     - Screenshot gallery
     - “How it works” steps
     - Privacy & trust snippet
     - CTA block
     - Footer
   - /product
     - Deeper feature descriptions + screenshot placeholders + mini use cases
   - /security
     - Security and privacy overview (plain language), data handling principles, user rights, disclaimers
   - /changelog
     - Render from a local markdown or JSON file in repo
   - /waitlist
     - Dedicated page for signups and “thank you” state
   - /press (optional but nice)
     - Brand assets placeholders, short boilerplate, contact form placeholder

6) What’s New (use as changelog seed content)
   - Added full password reset flow (forgot password screen, reset screen, secure link handling).
   - Deep link route: maliya://auth-callback routes into reset password.
   - Apple sign-in uses official button UI; Google sign-in button rebuilt to match sizing/spacing.
   - Added share-sheet ingestion for PDF statements (opens Statements flow).
   - Improved statement cards fetch reliability with retries and clearer error state.
   - Password-protected PDF UX improved (prompt handling + messaging).
   - Notification test tools hidden in release builds; only debug/flag shows.
   - iOS: added maliya URL scheme alongside existing com.maliya; LSHandlerRank for PDFs.
   - Android: enabled core library desugaring.

7) Components (must implement)
   - Navbar with animated underline active link
   - Hero section with device mock and CTA
   - FeatureCards grid
   - ScreenshotPlaceholder component (as described)
   - Testimonials placeholder (3 cards)
   - FAQ accordion
   - Pricing section (must be “Coming soon” / “Free during beta” placeholder)
   - Waitlist form component:
     - fields: email (required), name (optional), platform (iOS/Android/Web), emirate (optional), what_you_want (optional textarea)
     - consent checkbox (required): “I agree to be contacted about early access”
     - honeypot field hidden
     - success + error states
   - Footer with links and disclaimer

8) Implementation details
   - Provide clear file structure.
   - Provide instructions to run locally (pnpm preferred).
   - Provide a minimal design system:
     - typography scale, spacing, container widths
     - button variants: primary, secondary, ghost
   - Include a simple analytics hook placeholder (no real tracking ID).
   - Do NOT hardcode real backend keys or Supabase keys. Use env placeholders.

9) Output format
   - First: brief explanation of architecture and how to run.
   - Then: the full code (all relevant files) with correct paths and contents.
   - Ensure it compiles.

Brand details
- Product name: Maliya
- Market: UAE (English copy)
- Style: premium minimalist, modern fintech feel, calm color palette (but do not specify exact colors unless needed; use Tailwind neutrals and one accent).
